# first-react-js
SPA

Single page application blog assignment using Reactjs. Node.js is installed and the React modules are created. I used GULP for task 
runner and also installed SASS. To run this we use " npm start" from he command prompt. We can use CSS files to be imported for dynamic linking.
I created  footer, header, and nav bar.
